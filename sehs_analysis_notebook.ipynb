    "\n",
    "Chicago Public Schools (CPS) operates 11 Selective Enrollment High Schools (SEHS) where admission is determined by a composite score (grades + HSAT exam). CPS publishes cutoff scores and average scores of *admitted* students, but crucially, they do not publish the distribution of *all applicants*. Since we only observe students above a threshold, we're dealing with **truncated distributions**. This notebook develops a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) framework to recover the hidden population parameters $(\\mu, \\sigma)$ from the published truncated statistics, then uses these recovered parameters to inform a physics-based Monte Carlo simulation of the full admissions process.\n",

    "## 1. Background: The CPS Selective Enrollment System\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Institutional Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago Public Schools (CPS) operates 11 Selective Enrollment High Schools (SEHS), the most academically competitive public high schools in the city. These schools admit students based on a **composite score** ranging from 0 to 900 points:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Composite Score} = \\text{Grades Component (0-450)} + \\text{HSAT Score (0-450)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grades Component derives from 7th grade coursework in core subjects (Math, English, Science, Social Studies). The HSAT (High School Admissions Test) is a standardized exam administered by CPS each fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Tier System: Designing for Socioeconomic Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "CPS faces a fundamental tension: selective schools should admit the highest-achieving students, but without intervention, this would disproportionately favor students from affluent neighborhoods with better-resourced elementary schools. The **tier system** addresses this by segmenting the city into four socioeconomic tiers based on census tract characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tier | Socioeconomic Status | Typical Characteristics |\n",
    "|------|---------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| Tier 1 | Lowest | High poverty rate, low median income, low homeownership |\n",
    "| Tier 2 | Below average | Moderate poverty, below-average income |\n",
    "| Tier 3 | Above average | Low poverty, above-average income |\n",
    "| Tier 4 | Highest | Very low poverty, high income, high educational attainment |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each census tract is assigned to exactly one tier based on a composite index. Students inherit the tier of their home address, not their elementary school.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Seat Allocation: The 30/70 Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Each school allocates seats in two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: Rank-Based (30% of seats)**\n",
    "- The top 30% of seats go to the highest-scoring applicants *citywide*, regardless of tier.\n",
    "- This rewards absolute academic excellence.\n",
    "- In practice, these seats are dominated by Tier 3 and Tier 4 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: Tier-Based (70% of seats)**\n",
    "- The remaining 70% is divided equally among the four tiers (17.5% each).\n",
    "- Within each tier, seats go to the highest-scoring applicants *from that tier*.\n",
    "- This ensures each socioeconomic group has guaranteed representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 The Serial Dictatorship Matching Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "CPS uses a **serial dictatorship** (also called **deferred acceptance** in mechanism design) to match students to schools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Application phase**: Each student submits a ranked list of up to 6 SEHS schools.\n",
    "2. **Sorting phase**: Students are sorted by composite score (ties broken by lottery).\n",
    "3. **Matching phase**: Students are processed in score order. Each student is assigned to their highest-ranked school with available seats in their allocation category (Rank or Tier).\n",
    "4. **Cutoff determination**: The cutoff for each school-tier combination is the score of the last admitted student.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism is **strategy-proof**: students should truthfully rank schools by preference, not by perceived admission chances. It is also **Pareto-efficient**: no reallocation can make a student better off without making another worse off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 The Data Availability Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "CPS publishes:\n",
    "- **Cutoff scores**: Minimum score for admission by tier at each school\n",
    "- **Average scores**: Mean score of *admitted* students by tier\n",
    "- **Maximum scores**: Highest score among admitted students by tier\n",
    "\n",
    "CPS does **not** publish:\n",
    "- The full distribution of applicant scores (rejected + admitted)\n",
    "- The number of applicants by tier at each school\n",
    "- Individual-level application or outcome data\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **truncation problem**: we observe only the right tail of the score distribution (students at or above the cutoff). The published \"average\" is not the population mean; it is the mean of a truncated distribution."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## 2. The Truncation Problem: Mathematical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Notation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ denote the random variable representing applicant scores within a given tier. I model this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation:**\n",
    "- $\\mu$ = population mean (the true average score of *all* applicants in this tier, not just those admitted)\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ = population standard deviation (the spread of scores among all applicants)\n",
    "- $c$ = cutoff score (the minimum score for admission)\n",
    "- $M$ = maximum possible score (900 in the CPS system)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for the normality assumption**: Composite scores are the sum of two components, each aggregating multiple sub-scores (grades across subjects, exam scores across sections). By the Central Limit Theorem, such sums tend toward normality for large populations. This assumption is standard in educational measurement. However, I later relax this in the simulation by using skewed normal distributions to capture empirical deviations from symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The Truncated Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "CPS admits students with $X \\geq c$, where $c$ is the cutoff. The *observed* data comes from the **truncated distribution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\mid X \\geq c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical insight is that the observed mean is systematically biased upward:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{X}_{\\text{observed}} = \\mathbb{E}[X \\mid X \\geq c] > \\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This bias is called **selection bias** or **truncation bias**. It arises because we only see high scorers; the full population includes many students who scored below the cutoff and were rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 The Truncated Normal Mean Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For a normal distribution truncated to the interval $[c, M]$, the conditional expectation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid c \\leq X \\leq M] = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\frac{\\phi(\\alpha) - \\phi(\\beta)}{\\Phi(\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\alpha = \\frac{c - \\mu}{\\sigma}$ is the standardized lower bound (cutoff in $z$-score units)\n",
    "- $\\beta = \\frac{M - \\mu}{\\sigma}$ is the standardized upper bound\n",
    "- $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal PDF: $\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}$\n",
    "- $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF: $\\Phi(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{z} \\phi(t) \\, dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio $\\lambda(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\phi(\\alpha)}{1 - \\Phi(\\alpha)}$ is the **inverse Mills ratio** (or **hazard rate** of the standard normal). It quantifies how much truncation inflates the observed mean. When $\\alpha$ is large (cutoff far above the mean), $\\lambda(\\alpha)$ is large, and selection bias is severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 The Identification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given only:\n",
    "- The truncated mean $\\bar{X}_{\\text{obs}}$ (published by CPS as \"average score\")\n",
    "- The cutoff $c$ (published by CPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have **one equation in two unknowns** $(\\mu, \\sigma)$. The locus of solutions forms a curve (often called a \"banana\" due to its shape in parameter space). Many different $(\\mu, \\sigma)$ pairs produce the same truncated mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: Add a second constraint.** I use the **acceptance rate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X \\geq c) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{c - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{seats}}{\\text{applicants}} \\equiv r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With two independent constraints (truncated mean and acceptance rate), I can uniquely identify both $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: CPS does not publish tier-specific applicant counts. I estimate the acceptance rate $r$ using total seat counts and city-wide applicant estimates. This introduces some uncertainty, but sensitivity analysis shows the MLE results are robust to reasonable variations in $r$."

    "1. **Elite schools have extremely tight T4 distributions.** Northside has $\\hat{\\sigma} < 5$, meaning virtually all T4 applicants who rank Northside score in a narrow 10-15 point band near 890-900. This reflects both extreme competition and the 900-point ceiling.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **The $\\hat{\\mu}$ gap between elite and regional schools is enormous.** Elite T4 $\\hat{\\mu}$ ranges from 830-890; regional T4 $\\hat{\\mu}$ ranges from 590-720. This 200+ point gap reflects the fundamental bifurcation in Chicago's school system.\n",

    "\n",
    "The MLE analysis recovers population-level parameters $(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\sigma})$ for each school-tier combination, but it does not model the **behavioral dynamics** of how students choose schools. To simulate the full admissions process and predict cutoffs, I need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A model of how students form **preferences** over schools\n",
    "2. A mechanism for generating **realistic score distributions** by region and tier\n",
    "3. An implementation of the **serial dictatorship matching algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "I call this a \"physics-based\" simulation because it models students as agents with utility functions, analogous to particles in a potential field. Each student-school pair has an associated utility, and students rank schools by utility (highest to lowest).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Model Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utility function**: For student $i$ considering school $j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{ij} = P_j - d_{ij} \\cdot f(t_i, s_i) - \\mathbb{1}[r_i \\neq r_j] \\cdot \\gamma(r_i, r_j, s_i) + \\delta_j(t_i, s_i, r_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Meaning |\n",
    "|------|---------|\n",
    "| $P_j$ | Prestige of school $j$ (0-100 scale, based on cutoffs and reputation) |\n",
    "| $d_{ij}$ | Distance in miles from student $i$'s home to school $j$ |\n",
    "| $f(t_i, s_i)$ | Friction coefficient (varies by tier $t_i$ and score $s_i$; high scorers travel more) |\n",
    "| $\\gamma(r_i, r_j, s_i)$ | Cross-region penalty (students prefer local schools; penalty depends on region pair) |\n",
    "| $\\delta_j(\\cdot)$ | School-specific demand modifier (tuned via Optuna to match observed cutoffs) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score generation**: I use skewed normal distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{r,t} \\sim \\text{SkewNorm}(\\alpha_{r,t}, \\mu_{r,t}, \\sigma_{r,t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where parameters vary by region $r \\in \\{\\text{north}, \\text{loop}, \\text{west}, \\text{south}\\}$ and tier $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for skewed distributions**: The pure normal assumption from MLE is a simplification. Empirically, score distributions exhibit:\n",
    "- **Positive skew in lower tiers**: Long right tail of high achievers who beat the odds\n",
    "- **Negative skew in higher tiers**: Compression against the 900 ceiling\n",
    "\n",
    "The skewnorm distribution captures this asymmetry with a single additional parameter $\\alpha$ (skewness)."

    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Key Findings from MLE Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection bias is substantial and asymmetric across tiers.** For Tier 1 at elite schools, the observed mean exceeds the true population mean by 150-300 points. For Tier 4, the bias is only 10-30 points because truncation occurs closer to the population mean (the cutoff is not far above $\\mu$).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Elite schools exhibit extremely tight T4 distributions.** Northside has $\\hat{\\sigma} < 5$ for T4, implying virtually all admitted T4 students score 890+. This reflects both extreme competition and ceiling effects near the 900-point maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regional schools have fundamentally different applicant pools.** Schools like South Shore and King have $\\hat{\\sigma} > 60$ for T4, indicating heterogeneous applicant pools. This bifurcation suggests modeling elite and regional schools separately may improve accuracy.\n",

    "**Interpretation**: The model predicts cutoffs within 23 points on average, which is reasonable given the inherent stochasticity of the admissions process. However, some schools (particularly regional schools competing for overlapping applicant pools) remain challenging to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unknown applicant counts**: I estimate tier-specific applicant numbers; actual counts are not published by CPS. More accurate applicant data would improve the acceptance rate constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normality assumption in MLE**: Score distributions may deviate from normality, especially for regional schools with potential bimodality (e.g., students from Academic Centers vs. general population).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Static preferences**: The model assumes preferences are fixed. In reality, students may update preferences strategically based on perceived admission chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No sibling/legacy effects**: The model does not account for sibling preferences or Academic Center feeder patterns, which affect demand at specific schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **\"Whack-a-mole\" problem**: Regional schools (King, Brooks, Hancock, Lindblom) compete for overlapping applicant pools. Adjusting parameters to improve one school often worsens another. A future v14 model might separate elite and regional schools into distinct sub-models."

    "The subscript notation $(r, t)$ indexes a specific combination of region $r \\in \\{\\text{North}, \\text{Loop}, \\text{West}, \\text{South}\\}$ and tier $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This yields a $4 \\times 4 = 16$ parameter grid, reflecting the empirical observation that score distributions vary systematically across both geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. For example, $\\xi_{\\text{North}, 4}$ denotes the location parameter for Tier 4 students residing in the North region—a subpopulation that tends to exhibit higher scores due to correlation between neighborhood characteristics and academic preparation.\n",

    "### The Matching Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPS admission process implements a **serial dictatorship** mechanism, a classical assignment algorithm from mechanism design theory. This procedure is **strategy-proof**, meaning students have no incentive to misrepresent their true preferences—truthful reporting is a dominant strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the capacity constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $C_s^{\\text{Rank}}$: Rank-based seats at school $s$ (30% of total capacity)\n",
    "- $C_s^{(t)}$: Tier-$t$ seats at school $s$ (17.5% of total capacity, for $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds in two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1 (Rank-Based Matching):** \n",
    "\n",
    "All students, regardless of tier, are sorted by composite score in descending order. Beginning with the highest-scoring student, each student is considered in sequence. When a student is processed, the algorithm examines their preference list from most-preferred to least-preferred school. The student is assigned to the first school on their list that still has available rank-based seats. Once assigned, that school's rank seat count is decremented by one. If no preferred school has available rank seats, the student remains unmatched and proceeds to Phase 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase allocates 30% of each school's capacity to the highest-scoring applicants citywide, irrespective of their tier classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2 (Tier-Based Matching):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining 70% of seats are allocated within tier. For each tier $t$ from 1 to 4, the algorithm considers only unmatched students belonging to that tier, sorted by score in descending order. Each student is assigned to their highest-preference school that still has available tier-$t$ seats. This ensures that students compete primarily against others in their same socioeconomic tier for the majority of seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formalization via Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "To express this algorithm precisely, we introduce the concept of a **permutation**. In group theory, a permutation of a set $S$ is a bijective function $\\pi: S \\to S$. The set of all permutations of $n$ elements forms the **symmetric group** $S_n$, which has $n!$ elements. Permutations are useful here because the matching algorithm processes students in a specific order determined by their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation:** We write $\\pi(k) = i$ to mean \"the student in position $k$ of the ordering is student $i$.\" Equivalently, $\\pi^{-1}(i) = k$ gives student $i$'s position in the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\pi: \\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\to \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ be the permutation that orders students by score in descending order. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{\\pi(1)} \\geq X_{\\pi(2)} \\geq \\cdots \\geq X_{\\pi(n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tie-breaking:** When two students $i$ and $j$ have identical scores ($X_i = X_j$), the ordering is ambiguous. To resolve this, each student is assigned a **tie-breaker** $U_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 1)$ independently at random. The permutation $\\pi$ then satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi^{-1}(i) < \\pi^{-1}(j) \\iff (X_i > X_j) \\text{ or } (X_i = X_j \\text{ and } U_i < U_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures a strict total ordering exists with probability 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matching function $M: \\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\to \\mathcal{S} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$ is then computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_i = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "s^* & \\text{if } \\exists s^* \\in \\mathbf{P}_i : C_{s^*}^{(\\cdot)} > 0 \\text{ when student } i \\text{ is processed} \\\\\n",
    "\\emptyset & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_{s^*}^{(\\cdot)}$ denotes the relevant capacity (rank or tier-specific) at the time of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "For each school $s$, we run $B = 100$ independent simulations. Let $Y_s^{(b)} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ be the indicator that the user is admitted to school $s$ in simulation $b$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_s^{(b)} = \\mathbf{1}\\{M_{\\text{user}}^{(b)} = s\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo estimator for $P(A_s | X = x, T = t)$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{p}_s = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} Y_s^{(b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By the Strong Law of Large Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{p}_s \\xrightarrow{a.s.} P(A_s | X = x, T = t) \\quad \\text{as } B \\to \\infty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Error and Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $Y_s^{(b)} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_s)$ and the simulations are independent, the variance of the estimator is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_s) = \\frac{p_s(1 - p_s)}{B}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error, estimated from the data, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\hat{p}_s) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_s(1 - \\hat{p}_s)}{B}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $B = 100$ simulations:\n",
    "- If $\\hat{p}_s = 0.50$, then $\\widehat{\\text{SE}} = \\sqrt{0.25/100} = 0.05$, yielding a 95% CI of approximately $\\pm 10\\%$\n",
    "- If $\\hat{p}_s = 0.80$, then $\\widehat{\\text{SE}} = \\sqrt{0.16/100} = 0.04$, yielding a 95% CI of approximately $\\pm 8\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to $B = 50$ simulations (where the 95% CI would be $\\pm 14\\%$ at $\\hat{p} = 0.50$), doubling the simulation count reduces the confidence interval width by a factor of $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$. This reflects the general principle that Monte Carlo standard errors decrease at rate $O(1/\\sqrt{B})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence across simulations**: Each simulation $b$ draws an independent applicant pool from the score distribution model. This assumes the score-generating process is stationary across hypothetical replications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deterministic preferences for competitors**: Other students' preferences are computed via a deterministic utility function that depends on school prestige, geographic distance, and region-specific penalties. Only the user's preferences are fixed exogenously (set to the school being tested as #1 choice). \n",
    "\n",
    "   *In plain terms: your simulated competitors always \"decide\" where to apply using the same formula based on where they live and their scores. You, however, get to specify your own preference list. This means the simulation captures realistic competition patterns while letting you explore \"what if I ranked school X first?\" and running 100 simulations based of that set of rotating assumptions*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Proportional scaling**: Seat counts are scaled by $\\lambda = n/22000$ to maintain realistic competition ratios:\n",
    "   $$C_s^{(\\cdot)} \\leftarrow \\lfloor \\lambda \\cdot C_s^{(\\cdot)} \\rfloor$$\n",
    "   This preserves the seats-to-applicants ratio when using a smaller simulated population.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model misspecification**: The skew-normal score distributions are calibrated via Optuna hyperparameter optimization (a Bayesian optimization framework using Tree-structured Parzen Estimators) to minimize discrepancy between simulated and historical cutoff scores. However, this calibration targets aggregate statistics (cutoffs, acceptance rates) rather than the full distributional shape. Consequently, the fitted parameters $\\{\\xi_{r,t}, \\omega_{r,t}, \\alpha_{r,t}\\}$ may not perfectly capture features such as:\n",
    "   - Multimodality in the true score distribution\n",
    "   - Heavy tails or outlier behavior\n",
    "   - Temporal non-stationarity (year-to-year variation in applicant pools)\n",
    "   - Correlation structure between scores and unobserved confounders\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The simulation should therefore be interpreted as providing *plausible* probability estimates under the assumed model, not exact forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No strategic behavior**: Students are assumed to submit preferences truthfully. This assumption is justified by the strategy-proofness of serial dictatorship mechanisms—no student can improve their outcome by misrepresenting preferences, regardless of others' strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The output $\\hat{p}_s$ represents the **frequentist probability** of admission under repeated sampling from the model. It answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"If we drew many applicant pools from this model and ran the CPS matching algorithm each time, in what fraction would a student with your profile be admitted to school $s$?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from a Bayesian posterior probability, which would incorporate prior beliefs about model parameters. The frequentist interpretation treats the model parameters as fixed (though estimated) and quantifies uncertainty arising solely from the randomness in competitor draws."

    "# Key Findings and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis reveals several striking patterns in the CPS Selective Enrollment High School admissions process. The findings are organized into four major themes, each with significant implications for students, families, and policymakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Tier System Creates Massive Score Advantages (40-113 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tier-based admissions policy generates substantial score differentials across socioeconomic groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "| School | Tier 1 Cutoff | Tier 4 Cutoff | Tier Gap |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|---------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Lane Tech** | 746 | 859 | **113 pts** |\n",
    "| **Northside** | 706.5 | 893 | **186.5 pts** |\n",
    "| **Whitney Young** | 807 | 880 | **73 pts** |\n",
    "| **Payton** | 796 | 898 | **102 pts** |\n",
    "| **Jones** | 775 | 864 | **89 pts** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** A Tier 1 student can gain admission to Lane Tech with a score that would be 113 points below the Tier 4 threshold. This is the policy working as designed—creating pathways for students from under-resourced neighborhoods—but the magnitude is striking. At elite schools, tier assignment can be worth more than an entire letter grade on the composite score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Published Averages Are Systematically Misleading (~140-150 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLE analysis reveals a fundamental statistical illusion in CPS's published data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| School | Published Average (Admitted) | MLE-Recovered Population Mean | Selection Bias |\n",
    "|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Payton T1 | 841.3 | ~719 | **~122 pts** |\n",
    "| Lane Tech T1 | 758.2 | ~546 | **~212 pts** |\n",
    "| Northside T4 | 894.3 | ~888 | **~6 pts** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Truncation Problem:** CPS publishes the average score of *admitted* students, not all applicants. This is mathematically guaranteed to exceed the true population mean due to truncation at the cutoff. Our MLE recovers the hidden parameters by inverting the truncated normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Impact:** A parent seeing \"average: 876 at Payton\" might conclude their 850-scoring child is below average. In reality, an 850 likely places them well above the applicant pool mean. The published statistics, while accurate, create a distorted picture of competitiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Two Distinct SEHS Systems Exist Within One Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The data reveals a **bifurcated system** with fundamentally different competitive dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elite Schools (Payton, Northside, Young, Jones, Lane Tech)\n",
    "- **T4 Hidden Mean:** $\\mu \\approx 830-870$\n",
    "- **T4 Hidden SD:** $\\sigma \\approx 15-25$ (very tight)\n",
    "- **Competition:** Extremely intense; 5-10 point differences are decisive\n",
    "- **Geographic draw:** Citywide, especially North Side and Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regional Schools (Lindblom, Hancock, Brooks, King, Westinghouse, South Shore)\n",
    "- **T4 Hidden Mean:** $\\mu \\approx 600-700$\n",
    "- **T4 Hidden SD:** $\\sigma \\approx 60-100$ (much wider)\n",
    "- **Competition:** Less intense; 30-50 point buffers are common\n",
    "- **Geographic draw:** Primarily local neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication:** These are not simply \"more selective\" vs \"less selective\" versions of the same school type. They serve different populations with different score distributions, different geographic catchments, and different competitive pressures. Modeling them requires distinct parameter sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Three Regional Schools Exhibit Inverted Tier Gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "A counterintuitive pattern emerges at Lindblom, King, and South Shore:\n",
    "\n",
    "| School | Tier 1 Cutoff | Tier 4 Cutoff | Gap Direction |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n",
    "| Lindblom | 703 | 792 | Normal (+89) |\n",
    "| King | 654 | 774 | Normal (+120) |\n",
    "| South Shore | 576 | 711 | Normal (+135) |\n",
    "\n",
    "*2024 data shows these gaps, but 2025 shows dramatic inversions at some schools.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Explanations:**\n",
    "1. **Geographic preference:** Tier 1 students in South/West Side neighborhoods may preferentially rank local schools higher, creating concentrated demand\n",
    "2. **Elite school avoidance:** High-scoring Tier 1 students may not apply to Payton/Northside due to distance or cultural factors, redirecting competition to regional schools\n",
    "3. **Information asymmetry:** Tier 4 families may be more likely to use regional schools as \"safety\" choices, diluting competition\n",
    "\n",
    "This warrants further investigation—it suggests the tier system's effects are not uniform across the school landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policy Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Parents and Students\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't be intimidated by published averages.** They are inflated by 100-200 points due to selection bias. Your score's percentile in the applicant pool is far higher than it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tier 1/2 families have significant structural advantages at elite schools.** A Tier 1 student scoring 750 has realistic chances at Lane Tech; a Tier 4 student needs 860+.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regional schools offer genuine pathways for students scoring 550-750.** These are not \"lesser\" options—they are academically rigorous schools with less cutthroat admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consider geographic distance seriously.** The simulation shows cross-region penalties in student preferences. A South Side student ranking only North Side schools may face implicit disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For CPS and Policymakers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The tier system is achieving socioeconomic diversity**, but the magnitude of tier advantage varies wildly by school (40 pts at some, 180+ at others). Consider whether this variation is intentional.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Publishing applicant-pool statistics** (not just admitted) would help families make informed choices and reduce the misleading nature of current data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The inverted gaps at regional schools** suggest uneven demand patterns worth investigating. Are Tier 1 students being funneled into a subset of schools?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model transparency:** The matching algorithm is strategy-proof, but the score distributions and preference models that determine outcomes are opaque. Greater transparency would build trust.\n",
